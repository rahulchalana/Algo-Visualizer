## Colors during sorting
Elements become green after sorting is finished.

### Merge Sort
At each step, the algorithm creates two partitions: the first partition is highlighted in red, while the second partition is highlighted in pink. The elements within the partitions retain their original colors as they merge.

### Quick Sort
The pivot element initially appears pink, but it transforms into cyan once it occupies its correct position. As the sorting progresses, the pivot element turns green when all elements are properly sorted.
<br>

### Heap Sort
In the heap sort algorithm, the elements initially appear pink and then transition to cyan as they get sorted. Once all the elements are properly sorted, they turn green.
<br>

### Bubble Sort
Elements which are being compared appear red and pink. Sorted elements appear cyan.
